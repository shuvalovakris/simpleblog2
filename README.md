# README

This is my first project with Ruby on Rails.

I created a blog with Ruby on Rails with some functionality. the blog contains articles. All articles are displayed on the main page. When you click on the "read more" button, we go to a separate page for every article. every article can be edited and deleted, and comments can also be added. To be able to delete and edit articles, you must log in with the login "admin" and password "1q2". There are also separate pages “about us” and “add an article”. Article titles can only be created with at least 5 characters. Bootstrap styles are applied to the site.
the project contains 2 controllers: Posts and Comments and 2 models: Post and Comment."# simpleblog2"
